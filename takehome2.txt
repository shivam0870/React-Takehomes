Dog Pics
Write React code to implement the requirements given below ​​in the Codesandbox which is shared with Crio
Scenario 1: On page load

Display a select dropdown with these values
Random
Beagle
Boxer
Dalmatian
Husky
Random dog image loaded (as Random is selected). On refreshing, it should show another random dog image
“Next” button 
Scenario 2: On selecting a breed from the dropdown
If the selected breed is “Random”, show a random dog image
For other breeds, show a random dog image of that breed


Scenario 3: On clicking “Next” button
If the selected breed is “Random”, show another random dog image
For other breeds, show a different random dog image of that breed 

Notes
Create a component, src/session2-takehome/DogPics to store the UI and logic for this Takehome. Export the component and import it in src/App.js.
API Endpoints - API Documentation
Return a random dog image link - https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random 
Return a random dog image link for a breed - “https://dog.ceo/api/breed/<breed-name>/images/random”
Eg: https://dog.ceo/api/breed/husky/images/random
Don’t hardcode a default image link to show on load. Use the appropriate lifecycle method to fetch a random dog image
You must use axios to make API calls and handle errors (and not Fetch API)
Use the axios shorthand axios.get() to make the API request

Exports and imports
Axios
Axios GET request syntax (See “GET requests” section)

Tip
async-await syntax for JavaScript with arrow functions (or function expressions)
const add = async function(a) {
   let b = await fetchData();
   return a + b;
};


Understand the API response structure and status codes before starting to code
You can use an extension like JSONView for Chrome/Brave to format the API response on browser
