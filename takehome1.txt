User Dashboard
Write React code to implement the requirements given below in the Codesandbox which is shared with Crio
Scenario 1: On page load
Display 4 buttons
Two list items, Email and Name
Placeholder Image (Link)


Scenario 2: On clicking button with value 1 (similarly 2 or 3)
Load data from https://reqres.in/api/users/1
Endpoint https://reqres.in/api/users/<id>
Display the data
Show email
First name and last name combined as Name
Render image with “avatar” link given


Scenario 3: On clicking button 100
Handle the error response from the API call
Show an alert bar instead of displaying the data


Notes
Create a component, src/session1-takehome/UserDashboard to store the UI and logic for this Takehome. Export the component and import it in src/App.js.
API Endpoint - https://reqres.in/api/users/<id> 
Eg: https://reqres.in/api/users/1
Ids 1-12 returns data with a 200 status code
Other values return {} with 404
You must use axios to make API calls and handle errors (and not Fetch API)
Use the axios shorthand axios.get() to make the API request

Tip
async-await syntax for JavaScript with arrow functions (or function expressions)
const add = async function(a) {
   let b = await fetchData();
   return a + b;
};


Understand the API response structure and status codes before starting to code
You can use an extension like JSONView for Chrome/Brave to format the API response on browser

Installing and importing axios in Codesandbox
Axios needs to be added as the project dependency (installed) for us to be able to use it in the project. Follow the steps below to install axios in Codesandbox

Find the Dependencies section within the File explorer section

Type axios in the search bar and select the first option

  You’ll find axios displayed in the dependencies list


Import axios to the appropriate component by adding below import statement
import axios from "axios";
